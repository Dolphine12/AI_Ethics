        "\n",
        "-The **COMPAS dataset** is widely used to assess the fairness of algorithmic risk scores in criminal justice. In this study, we used IBM's AI Fairness 360 toolkit to investigate potential racial bias in the dataset’s risk predictions, particularly focusing on disparities between Black and White individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "-Our baseline analysis used:\n",
        "1.  logistic regression to predict recidivism, and fairness metrics were computed using the AIF360 library. The initial results revealed significant bias: the false positive rate (FPR) for Black individuals was considerably higher than for White individuals, indicating that Black individuals were more frequently misclassified as high-risk when they did not reoffend, highlighting a key fairness concern.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Visualization of the FPR by race clearly illustrated this disparity, reinforcing concerns raised by prior research and media investigations into the use of COMPAS scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this bias, we applied the Reweighing algorithm, a preprocessing technique that adjusts instance weights in the training data to mitigate bias while preserving the original labels. After reweighing, the disparate impact metric improved substantially, and the difference in FPR across racial groups was reduced. However, slight trade-offs in overall model accuracy were observed, a common consequence of fairness optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, our analysis confirmed the presence of racial bias in the COMPAS dataset, particularly in the form of false positive disparities. Remediation via reweighing proved partially effective in reducing this unfairness. Future work could explore more advanced mitigation techniques like adversarial debiasing or post-processing methods to further improve fairness without compromising model performance. Ultimately, fairness-aware tools like AIF360 are essential for building transparent and accountable AI systems in sensitive domains such as criminal justice."
